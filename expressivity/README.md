# An Exploration of Neural Network Expressivity and Approximation Dynamics

## Results
The visualizations are stored in the `output` directory. Each directory within `output` corresponds to a different experiment and are named according to the following format: `d[depth]_w[width]`. For example, `d2_w32` corresponds to a network with 2 hidden layers and 32 hidden units per layer. `sincos` corresponds the use of positional encoding, and `b[number_of_bands]` corresponds to the number of bands used in the positional encoding.

## Using the web viewer
The web viewer is a simple HTML page that allows you to view the results of the experiments in an organized manner. It is hosted here: https://dylanhu7.github.io/apma1941d/

Sometimes, the videos will fail to load due to the amount of videos on the page. In this case, you may try refreshing the page or restarting your browser. If this does not work, you can try running the web viewer locally by downloading the repository and opening the local HTML file in your browser.
